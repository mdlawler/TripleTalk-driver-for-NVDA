This driver fully supports the TripleTalk USB synthesizer.  Note that when changing the pauses setting the file %windir%\ttusbd.ini usually c:\windows\ttusbd.ini must be written as the TripleTalk driver uses this file to control the setting.  If you are not running as administrator and UAC is on you will get prompted with a UAC dialog to change this feature.

All features, rate, pitch, volume, inflection, and variant of the voices are supported.

Any suggestions/requests/bug reports etc can be sent to Mike Lawler at mdlawler@lawlers.us
